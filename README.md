## âœ¨ Special Features
- *Precision*: Meticulous error handling with distinct management strategies for system calls and program-specific errors.

- *Advanced parser*: (For a pipex project.) It handles nested single and double quotes, backslash (`\`) escape sequences, newline (`\n`), and tab (`\t`) characters, and more.
- *Clean*: I did my best to keep it simple and readable, without too many files.
